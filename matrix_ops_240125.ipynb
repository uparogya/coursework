The English word *dimensions* refers to the shape of a matrix, number of rows and columns. *Dimension* has a different meaning in linear algebraic terms, typically referring to the length of a vector or denoting the number of *linearly independent* rows or columns in a matrix, or set of vectors. Be aware of this distinction when reading from different sources. We can always use shape to avoid confusion when talking about the number of rows and columns of a matrix if needed.

There is not a single standard or convention, so be careful when using other resources.\n",
