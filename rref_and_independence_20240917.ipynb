    "## Reduced row echelon form\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we can put a matrix into reduced row echelon form (rref) through a series of elementary row operations. Effectively we are using linear combinations of the row of a matrix to make it *row-reduced*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is needed for a matrix to be in reduced-row echelon form?\n",
    "+ Any row that is not all zeros must start with a leading \"1,\" called a pivot. Any row without a pivot must be all zeros and will come at the \"bottom\" of the matrix.\n",
    "+ Pivots (leading 1's) must have zeros above and below in the same column of the matrix.\n",
    "+ A pivot in a \"higher\" row must be to the \"left\" of a pivot in a \"lower\" row. This also implies that a pivot in a \"lower\" row must be to the \"right\" of a pivot in a \"higher\" row.\n",
    "+ Again, any row without a pivot must be all zeros and will come at the \"bottom\" of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use any row combinations needed to achieve the **rref** of a matrix. Generally this is accomplished by a sequence of elementary row operations moving the matrix to the form described by focusing on:\n",
    "+ creating pivots from top left of the matrix (top rows, left cols) down to the right,\n",
    "+ after getting a pivot, zeroing out below the pivot in the same column, one row at a time,\n",
    "+ Once pivots (leading ones) are exhausted, then zero above the pivots starting in the rightmost pivot columns first,\n",
    "+ and move back up to the left zeroing above each pivot.\n",
    "+ You may swap rows if needed. You may scale (mulitply a row by a scalar) as needed. And use scale versions of pivot rows to zero above and below a pivot in the pivot column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue with an example."
