They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the doors. Sam 
they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In spite of his 
delight in Bilbo’s company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of 
the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice 
rose in song.

A Elbereth Gilthoniel,
silivren penna míriel
o menel aglar elenath!
Na-chaered palan-díriel
o galadhremmin ennorath,
Fanuilos, le linnathon
nef aear, sí nef aearon!

Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and the fire 
was on his face like summer-light upon the trees. Near him sat the Lady Arwen. 
To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his dark cloak was 
thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a star shone on his 
breast. They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed to Frodo that Arwen 
turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced 
his heart.

He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell 
like clear jewels of blended word and melody. ‘It is a song to Elbereth,’ 
said Bilbo. 'They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed Realm, many 
times tonight. Come on!’

—J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, “Many 
Meetings”
