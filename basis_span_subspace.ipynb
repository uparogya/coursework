    "## Structure of $\\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are close to uncovering more structure of a real vector spaces, $\\mathbb{R}^n$. First a quick recap of we know so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbb{R}^n$ be a real vector space with vectors $\\{\\textbf{v}_1, \\textbf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\textbf{v}_m \\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$ with scalar coefficients, $a_1, \\ldots, a_m $ each from $\\mathbb{R}.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions and assorted facts:\n",
    "+ A vector $\\textbf{v}$ is a *linear combination* of vectors from the set $\\{\\textbf{v}_1, \\textbf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\textbf{v}_m \\}$ if we can write $$\\textbf{v} = a_1 \\textbf{v}_1 + \\ldots + a_m \\textbf{v}_m.$$\n",
    "+ A set of vectors $\\textbf{v}$ is *linearly dependent* if at least one vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of other vectors from the set.\n",
    "+ A set of vectors is *linearly independent* if it is not dependent. This may not seem helpful. It is. Definining linear dependence using linear combinations of vectors is intuitive and practical to check and compute.\n",
    "+ The idea of independence is still somewhat intuitive but difficult to compute. Some consequences of our definitions are that\n",
    "  1. independent vectors must be nonzero vectors, and\n",
    "  2. the *only* way to form a linear combination of independent vectors to produce the zero vector is when every scalar coefficient $a_k$ equal to the scalar zero.\n",
    "+ We can check the dependence and independence of vectors using the reduced row echelon form (rref) of a matrix by putting the vectors in question into the columns of a matrix $A$.\n",
    "+ Columns (and rows) of a matrix $A$ corresponding to pivot columns (and rows) of the `rref(A)` are independent.\n",
    "+ Further the nonpivot columns in `rref(A)` give the weights (scalar coefficients) describing the linear combination of the independent columns needed to reconstruct the original column vector in question.\n",
    "+ Solutions to linear systems can be described by considering the associated matrix equation $A\\textbf{x}=\\textbf{b}$.\n",
    "+ The augmented matrix $[A|\\textbf{b}]$ cannot have a pivot in last column of `rref([A|b])` in order for a solution to exist.\n",
    "+ We need to consider three cases for a linear system with $m$ equations and $n$ unknowns (which corresponds to our set up with an $ n \\times m $ matrix $A$.)\n",
    "  1. $m = n$: The matrix $A$ is square.\n",
    "  2. $m \\leq n$: The matrix $A$ has less rows than columns. The system is underdetermined. An exact solution when it exists will likely be infinite.\n",
    "  3. $m \\geq n$: The matrix $A$ has more rows than columns. The system is overdetermined. An exact solution is (possible but) unlikely\n",
    "+ For each case we need to consider possible pivots and pivot positions. Note $m$ and $n$ describe the shape of $A$ giving the number of rows and columns respectively."
