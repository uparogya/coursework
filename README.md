### CMPT 202: Intro to Data Structures — Fall 2023

**Branch:** [cmpt202](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt202)

### CMPT 251: Computer Systems & Programming — Fall 2023

**Branch:** [cmpt251](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt251)

**Featured Assignment:** [Project 2 – Memory Manipulation in C](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt251/project02)
In this project, I implemented image transformations on bitmap files — converting them to grayscale, posterizing, resizing, mirroring, and rotating — all using raw memory manipulation in C. Working directly with pointers and pixel arrays strengthened my understanding of memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and performance in low-level programming. This project was one of the most enjoyable ones as it made abstract concepts in C feel tangible through visual outcomes.

### CMPT 375: Web Applications — Spring 2024

**Repository:** [cmpt375](https://github.com/uparogya/client-project-jacl)

**Featured Project:** [JACL Website Project](https://github.com/uparogya/client-project-jacl)
Collaborated with Media Arts & Design students to develop a professional website for the Japanese American Citizens League (Salt Lake Chapter). This real-world client project strengthened my ability to communicate across disciplines, manage a shared Git workflow, and deliver production-ready front-end and back-end features using modern web frameworks.

### CMPT 306: Algorithms — Fall 2024

**Branch:** [cmpt306](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt306)

**Featured Assignment:** [Final Project – Pathfinding Algorithms](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt306/final_project)
Designed and implemented multiple pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, Greedy, and Priority Queue variants) to compute optimal paths on elevation maps (.tiff). The project taught me how algorithmic trade-offs affect efficiency and accuracy, particularly in spatial analysis and map-based navigation. Comparing execution times and outputs deepened my understanding of algorithm design, heuristics, and complexity.

### CMPT 341: Programming Languages — Fall 2024

**Branch:** [cmpt341](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt341)

**Featured Assignment:** [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt341/Homework%201)
Built an interpreter for the esoteric programming language Brainfuck, which required implementing lexical analysis, parsing, and runtime evaluation. Through this project, I learned how interpreters translate abstract syntax into machine-executable behavior, developing a strong appreciation for precision, syntax handling, and language semantics.

### WCSAM 203: Linear Algebra — Fall 2024

**Branch:** [wcsam203](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/wcsam203)

**Featured Assignment:** [Final Project – Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/blob/wcsam203/Idea/recom.ipynb)
Developed a recommendation system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on a dataset of 50 users and 50 movies. The system analyzed user–movie rating patterns to generate personalized recommendations. By comparing **Cosine Similarity** and **Euclidean Distance**, I concluded that Cosine Similarity is ideal for identifying users with similar taste regardless of rating scale, while Euclidean Distance is better when absolute rating differences matter.

### CMPT 301: Artificial Intelligence — Spring 2025

**Branch:** [cmpt301](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt301)

### CMPT 351: Operating Systems — Spring 2025

**Branch:** [cmpt351](https://github.com/uparogya/coursework/tree/cmpt351)

### CMPT 322: Software Engineering — Spring 2025

**Repository:** [cmpt322](https://github.com/uparogya/bobs-math-adventure)

**Featured Project:** [Bob’s Math Adventure](https://github.com/uparogya/bobs-math-adventure)
Simulated a real-world software development cycle by collaborating in an Agile team to design and develop an educational math game. Practiced requirements gathering, sprint planning, testing, and code reviews, gaining hands-on experience with teamwork and full lifecycle software engineering.
