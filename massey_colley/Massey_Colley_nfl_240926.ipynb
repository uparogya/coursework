    "## The Massey method\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenneth Massey developed this ranking scheme as an undergraduate in 1997. The method ranks teams not only on win-loss but also takes into account the point difference in each game.  Not all teams need to play the same number of games, or each other. Massey ranking has been used in the NCAA Division 1 Bowl Championship Series in the past, and these ideas still inform current ranking algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a linear algebra point of view, Massey ranking uses least squares (regression) on a particular matrix, $M_1.$  \n",
    "\n",
    "We define $M_1$ by setting up a matrix where each row represents a game, and each column represents a team.  For each game a \"1\" is placed in the column of the winner, and a \"-1\" in the column of the loser. If the game is a tie, we place a 1 in each column for the teams that played in that game.  For each game played (number of rows) we also construct a $p_1$ column with the point difference for the game represented by that row. Note we are subtracting the losing score from the winning score, so all point differences in this vector will be nonnegative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that we have a ranking of teams based on games played, we consider our ranking vector $r,$ and the matrix equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$M_1 \\mathbf{r} \\quad = \\quad \\mathbf{p_1}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that there exists a ranking vector, $\\mathbf{r}$, giving weights to a linear combination of the columns of $M_1$ that equals the point differential vector $\\mathbf{p_1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is unlikely to be such a ranking vector, $\\mathbf{r}$, which solves the system of linear equations originally described. In this case $\\mathbf{p_1}$ will not be in the column space of $M_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use projections to find the \"least squares\" solution to the weights given by the ranking vector $\\mathbf{r}.$ The least squares solution describes the closest vector in the column space of $M_1$ to the actual point difference vector $\\mathbf{p_1}$."
