    "- Unlike the depth in pacman project, since the branch factor is 7 at most states, we define one level of the tree as one move from either X or O, which is **NOT** a round of play from both X and O. Here is the graphical explanation: \n",

    "- You may use cache in the function, but you need to make sure your cache includes state, depth, and player, which is not the cache1 we used in the assignment of tictactoe. I did not use it in my solution. I suggest you to add cache feature after you complete this assignment in case the set up of your cache is wrong. "
